1. Can I explain what my code does?
The code I have written is designed to reflect my resume. It consists of several components which provide several details about my education, past work experience etc..It also includes my contact information so that recruiter may contact me while considering my application.

2. What was my coding process?
Firstly, I read through the document providing the details of this assignment, noted all the major requirements on notes application and organised them. Then I made the folder structure and started coding. 

3. What challenges did I have?
I was having a bit of trouble in adding experience section because double unordered lists were a little confusing to me in code. So I needed to seek help online through websites like w3schools.

4. What would I do differently now?
I think adding a navigation menu would have been a good idea, since this was not a such big project I did not feel it is necessary. Secondly, instead of using them as images, SVGs could be added directly.
